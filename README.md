# Web-based Codebook

The web codebook is a javascript library that provides a concise summary of every variable in a dataset. The codebook includes interactive features such as real-time filters and requires minimal user configuration. More detail is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/RhoInc/web-codebook/wiki) and a working example is available [here](https://rhoinc.github.io/viz-library/examples/0009-web-codebook-demo/example.html).
